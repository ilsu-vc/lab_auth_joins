SQL joins are essential for combining data from multiple tables in a relational database, allowing us to retrieve related information efficiently. An INNER JOIN returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables, making it useful when we want data that exists in both sources. A LEFT JOIN includes all rows from the left table and matches from the right table, filling in NULLs where no match exists, so that we see all left-side data even if some right-side details are missing. A RIGHT JOIN does the opposite: it returns all rows from the right table and matches from the left, showing NULLs for left-side data when there is no match. A CROSS JOIN creates every possible combination of rows from both tables, which is useful for generating all possible pairings but can result in very large result sets. Finally, a FULL OUTER JOIN returns all rows from both tables, showing matches where possible and NULLs where there is no corresponding row in either table. Each join type serves a different purpose depending on whether we want strict matches, all data from one side, or a complete view of both tables.
